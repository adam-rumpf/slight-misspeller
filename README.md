# Slight Misspeller

A Python module that generates slightly misspelled versions of text files.

This module defines several functions for converting strings or text files into slightly misspelled versions of themselves. The misspelling is meant to be slight enough to still yield a pronounceable (for English) word that is close enough to the original word for the text to still be somewhat understandable.

What is the purpose of this module? That is an excellent question.
