# Slight Misspeller

A Python module that generates slightly misspelled versions of text files.

This module defines several functions for converting strings or text files into slightly misspelled versions of themselves. Rather than changing letters completely at random, some rudimentary (English) phonotactics are applied in an attempt to yield a pronounceable result. The alterations are also meant to be minor enough for the text to remain vaguely understandable.

What is the purpose of this module? That is an excellent question.
